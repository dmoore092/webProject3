                    Hello, My name is Dale, and I am an associate interpreter with the Department of Access Services (DAS) at Rochester Institute of Technology/National Technical Institute for the Deaf.  I have over 9 years of professional interpreting  experience  in a variety of settings including post-secondary, community, medical, and Video Relay Service.  I have worked as both a staff interpreter and a freelance interpreter.

                    I began working with Deaf people at the Tennessee School for the Deaf in 2004, as a Youth Service Worker. It was here that I learned ASL, and began attending interpreting workshops and conferences. In 2007 I began working for Sorenson VRS as a Video Relay Interpreter, and in 2010 I moved to Rochester, NY and began freelancing. That same year I also started working for Interpretek, Inc as a Staff Interpreter
