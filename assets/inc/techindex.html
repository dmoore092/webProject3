                    Hello, My name is Dale, and I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester NY. I have 9 years of experience at a Sign Language Interpreter and attend class part-time.

                    I am majoring in Computer Information Technology and am beginning my 3rd year. The majority of the classes I have taken so far have been focusing on development. I am familiar with Web Development(HTML/CSS/PHP), scripting(Bash, Python, Powershell) and Object Oriented Programming(Java, Python). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also run a homelab consisting of a server running an ESXi Hypervisor that allows me to experiement with different technologies. Through this homelab, I have a basic familiarity with creation/deletion of VM's, Server/Desktop Linux, web servers, reverse proxies, Network Attached Storage and running a small Media Server with about 15 "customers".
